# Finetechcm Development Management Todo Application

## Current Focus: Firebase Integration and Authentication

### Immediate Priority [Current Sprint]

1. Firebase Authentication & Security [URGENT]
   - [ ] GitHub OAuth Configuration
     - [ ] Set up GitHub OAuth app
     - [ ] Configure Firebase Auth with GitHub provider
     - [ ] Handle auth state changes
     - [ ] Implement sign-in/sign-out flow
   
   - [ ] User Management
     - [ ] User collection in Firestore
     - [ ] User profile data structure
     - [ ] Role management (admin/user)
     - [ ] User preferences storage

   - [ ] Security Rules
     - [ ] Document-level access control
     - [ ] Role-based permissions
     - [ ] Data validation rules
     - [ ] User data protection

2. Firestore Data Structure [Critical]
   - [ ] Collections:
     ```typescript
     users/
       - uid (GitHub ID)
         - displayName
         - email
         - photoURL
         - role
         - preferences
         - lastActive
         - createdAt

     features/
       - featureId
         - title
         - description
         - type (frontend/both)
         - status
         - priority
         - assignedTo
         - createdBy
         - createdAt
         - updatedAt
         - progress
         - category
         - labels

     comments/
       - commentId
         - featureId
         - userId
         - content
         - createdAt
         - mentions
         - parentId (for threads)

     activity/
       - activityId
         - type
         - userId
         - featureId
         - timestamp
         - description
         - metadata
     ```

3. Real-time Listeners & Updates
   - [ ] Feature updates
   - [ ] Comment synchronization
   - [ ] Activity feed
   - [ ] User presence
   - [ ] Progress tracking

4. User Interface Flow
   - [ ] Authentication Screens
     - [ ] GitHub login button
     - [ ] Loading states
     - [ ] Error handling
     - [ ] Success redirects
   
   - [ ] Feature Management
     - [ ] List/Grid views
     - [ ] Creation/Edit forms
     - [ ] Real-time updates
     - [ ] Progress tracking

   - [ ] Discussion System
     - [ ] Comment threads
     - [ ] Mentions
     - [ ] Real-time updates

## Completed Core Features
- [x] Project structure
- [x] TypeScript configuration
- [x] Base component system
- [x] Initial Firebase setup
- [x] Basic feature management

## Questions to Resolve
1. Should we implement offline support using Firebase persistence?
2. Do we need custom claims in Firebase Auth for role management?
3. What's the best way to handle file attachments in features/comments?
4. How should we structure the activity feed for optimal querying?
5. What indexes do we need for our common queries?

## Next Steps (In Order)
1. Complete Firebase Authentication with GitHub
2. Implement Firestore security rules
3. Set up all data collections and relationships
4. Add real-time listeners for features
5. Build user interface components

## Notes
- Everything runs through Firebase - no separate backend
- Focus on real-time synchronization
- Ensure proper security rules for all collections
- Maintain data consistency across collections
- Use Firebase transactions for critical updates
- Keep the data structure flat and efficient
- Implement proper error handling for all Firebase operations
- Use batch operations where appropriate
- Monitor Firebase quotas and usage
